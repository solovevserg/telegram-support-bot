# telegram-support-bot

Simple bot for getting help to your clients.
Inspired by [telegram-support-bot](https://github.com/bostrot/telegram-support-bot) by [Eric Trenkel](https://github.com/bostrot).

## Using

1. Create a bot via BotFather in telegram and save its token
2. Create a group for answering clients' questions
3. Add bot to the group and make it admin

âš  Note: When a second admin is added the group is upgraded to supergroup and its id is changed!

### Docker
